# Hypothesis Testing using Chi Squared Test

## Description
There are two datasets used in this notebook.
* species_info.csv
  - It contains information about the characteristics of each animal.
* observations.csv
  - It contains number of animals of each type that were spotted.

The first data set contains information about different species of animals and plants currently in a national park. The features present are
* category - Class each animal belongs to
* scientific_name - Scientific name of the animal
* common_names - Other names used to denote the animal
* conservation_status - Endangerment status of the animal

## Hypothesis Testing

We perform hypothesis testing to determine classes that has a significantly higher or lower number of animals that face the threat of endangerment.
